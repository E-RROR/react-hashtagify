# Bug triage

This sections explains how bug triaging is done for your project. Help beginners by including examples to good bug reports and providing them questions they should look to answer.

* You can help report bugs by filing them here: [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/E-RROR/react-tagify/issues)
* You can look through the existing bugs here: [Bugs](https://github.com/E-RROR/react-tagify/labels/bug).

* You can help us diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:

  * Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
  * Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?   
  * Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
  * What tags should the bug have?  
  * Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster?
